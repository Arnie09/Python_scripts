## Scripts descriptions : 
 
### Instagram hastags 

   In this script i have scraped instagram which is a javascript rendered website to scrap tags based on topic that the user wants.
   The user can then use copy these hashtags which are usually the most popular hashtags in that topic.
   This script may be implemented to run on a cloud to feed an API which will be connected to an android app but that work is in 
   development.

### Movie database 
    
    In this script i have implemented some basic python functionality in order to search through a file structure to look for media files

    stored in a local json file which can be used later or fed to some other application. Made as a part of my python learning project.
