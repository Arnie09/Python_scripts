# Python_scripts

Do you like writing scripts in python as a hobby? Doesn't scripting make monotonous wrk easier? Weren't computers made to do boring monotonous works? Well, if you agree with the statement and like being lazy then submit your delicious python scripts into this fine repository. Lets make it a collection as a reference for other lazy script writers like yourself. 

All you need to do if you want your script to be a part of this collection is by simply forking this repository, adding your delicious scripts and sending a pull request. After your code has been reviewed, it will be added here. Some rules to keep in mind while making the scripts : 

* The script must solve a task, a day to day task more conveniently.
* The script should run uniformly across all machines having the same OS. 
* If the script is dependant on some open source programs please include the program/the link of the program

Since all the scripts are made with Python, it is necessary to have python in your system. The additional libraries required by each script has been written in the requirements section of the specific program below!
